 Well if you Sensex as it is in numbers you are right, adjusted inflation and stocks reshuffling, personally I believe 28-29k.
Record @SENSEX. Crossd 24k.is it Modi? 
SO, SENSEX - 24,000 winning it! #ExitPolls2014
 Sensex breaches 24,000 level for the first time” only to fall back on it's teeth again
It's clearly #NaMo effect for the first time Sensex breaching out above 24,000 hits new record !! and NSE to follow with above 7000 points !
It's #sensex day! At all time record high w/ hovering at above 24000 points today! 
 sensex Northbound. Hope it doesn't take a U turn to meet Miss Jayalalitha
Magic of NaMo sarkar,SENSEX move over 24K ,Really bull 4 mkt,But be cautious..,target by 16 may it touches to 25K....speculate & earn
Sensex over 24,000 the market has already decided the poll results it seems!!
That's the reason it's foolish to expect the markets to dictate public policy "@FirstpostBiz: #Sensex above 24,000"
 Seems like everybody is breaking their FDs,bonds n savings to pump into market... BC tremendous surge sensex !
Sensex @ 24000..unbelievable run..Nifty+ 500 pts in 3 days...it seems like a test match as we hv 2 days left..then wats instore?
#Sensex #Markets #ExitPolls2014 24K it is....how long before it touches 25K. Any guesses
if opinion poll only can push the sensex to record high imagine on 16th when it becomes a reality.
Sensex Soars 370 Points to Record High as Exit Polls Predict NDA Win 
sensex nearing 24000 and nifty breached 7100, is it Indian stock markets ?
Today Sensex touched the highest point.It opened at 350 points higher & Nifty 70 points-This is Modi effect
Sensex rallies, at record high..! But I think it's premature to react, Mr Sensex!
Sensex soaring, streets roaring, news channels warring - yeah its election season in India...feeling it!
Stock markets on the up is a great sign. Long may it continue! NaMo Rally on Sensex!
Rupee gains against the dollar. Sensex rises to a record breaking high. Guess it is the Modi effect starting to show on the economy.
Looking at the Sensex and Nifty rally so high, it's positive vibes all around for the change to come!
